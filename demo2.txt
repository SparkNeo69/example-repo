this is a sample repo!
markdown 

--git clone path filename - copying from remote to local server

--git status - we will get untracked file if we have not added new file

now add file to staging 
--git add demo1.txt

now the new file is tracked but not yet commited 

by agan giving git status command 
--git status - changes to be commited 

control+l - clear

--git commit -m "initial commit" master initial commit   create mode demo1.txt
--git status - nothing to commit

now our file is commited to the local repo and this time will log when you push this copy to ther remote repo
now add this file to remote repo
git push origin master
login to ur account
--git push origin master

if you further change this demo1.txt file 
then check git status again 
it will show modified: demo1.txt


so we need to add and commit this again and for chacking diff we can do as follows
git diff demo1.txt
